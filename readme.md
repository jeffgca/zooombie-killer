# Zoombie Killer, qu'est-ce que c'est?

> Rationale: if you spend all day on zoom calls, you will slowly accrue a bunch of tabs all pointed at the Zoom postattendee page, eg something like:
> 
> `https://us02web.zoom.us/postattendee?...`
> 
> This extension kills these tabs in your browser with extreme prejudice, and keeps a count of how many tabs it has closed in a toolbar icon.
